I've found Axon/Evidence.com reporting to leave much to be desired so I'm slowly building a program to analyze various metrics.
Right now all it does is sum total file sizes within a date range which could be done in Excel, but I prefer to just run this as
opening reports of this size in Excel can take a while!

Eventually I intend to add functionality to filter by uploader / department / etc which will make it far more useful than Excel.
